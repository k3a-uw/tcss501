# Welcome to TCSS501: Analysis of Algorithms and Data Structures
 
This repository supports the first course in the Graduate Certificate Program for Software Development Engineering, TCSS501

# Course Description #
Introduces techniques used in algorithm analysis and data structures.  Includes review of basic algebra, time space complexity, big O notation.  Covers fundamental data structures and algorithms with an emphasis on implementing them in high-level programming languages.  Emphasis on data structures such as array lists, linked lists, queues, stacks, trees and hash tables and algorithms such as sorting, selection, binary search and application of recursion in data structures.

# Repository Structure
`./JupyterNotebooks/` Will contain sample, interactive files that can be run in Jupyter to give students additional insights into course content.  Notebooks will be add throughout the course.

`./SampleCode/` Will contain sample python scripts that can be ran independently.  There will be a some overlap with the code in JupyterNotebooks, but there may be sample code in this folder that does _not_ exist as a `.ipynb` file.
